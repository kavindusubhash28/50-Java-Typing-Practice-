# 50 Java Programs – ICET Assignment

This repository contains 50 small Java programs written as part of an assignment given by **ICET** (Institute of Computer Engineering and Technology). The objective of this task is to enhance my **Java basics**, improve **coding speed**, and strengthen **logical thinking** through consistent practice.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Improve Java programming fundamentals  
- Boost coding speed and accuracy  
- Practice logical problem-solving  
- Complete ICET coursework requirement  

## 📁 Structure

Each program is saved as a separate `.java` file in the root folder. All programs are written using only **Notepad** and compiled via **Command Prompt**, without using any IDE. This was done intentionally to build raw coding and typing skills.

Topics covered include:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Loops and Conditionals  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming  
- Input and Output handling  
- Simple mathematical and logical problems

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open Command Prompt  
2. Navigate to the folder containing `.java` files  
3. Compile:  


## 📚 Assignment Details

- **Course**: Java Programming  
- **Institute**: ICET  
- **Assignment**: Practice 50 Java programs  
- **Tools Used**: Notepad, Command Prompt  
- **Submission Format**: PDF with code and output screenshots

## 📌 Note

All programs are handwritten and tested via the command line. This exercise helped me build a strong foundation in Java while developing discipline in manual code writing and execution.
